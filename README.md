大一下学期的课程Web开发的大作业。

由于没有大项目开发的经验，所以文件管理上漏洞百出，望多包涵。

CSS文件夹下包含网站所有自己写的CSS配置。

HTML文件夹上包含网站的所有html代码。

JS文件夹下包含自己写的网站所有JS代码。

MATERIAL文件夹下包含所有图标以及使用的第三方库，但因为经验不够，没有细致管理，后续也懒得管了，所以也包含未使用的第三方库。

This is the Web development final homework in the second semester of freshman year.

Since I have no experience about large project development, so the file management is full of loopholes, please forgive me.

The CSS directory contains all the css configurations of the site.

The HTML directory contains all the html code of the site.

The JS directory contains all the JS code I wrote of the site.

The MATERIAL directory contains all ICONS and the third-party libraries used. However, due to my lack of experience, I did not manage them carefully and did not bother to manage them later, so this directory also included the unused third-party libraries.
